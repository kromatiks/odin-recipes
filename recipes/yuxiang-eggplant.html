    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>750 g Chinese eggplant, halved and cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
      <li>1½ Tbsp Doubanjiang</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp chopped ginger</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp chopped garlic</li>
      <li>150 ml stock or water</li>
      <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp light soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tsp black vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tsp corn starch mixed into 1 tsp water</li>
      <li>4 green onions, sliced</li>
      <li>sesame oil for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour enough oil to cover the eggplant into a wok and put over high heat.
        When the oil is hot and shimmering, fry the eggplant pieces in batches
        until they begin to brown, about 3-4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove, place on a paper towel to soak up excess oil and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour out most of the oil, leaving only a couple of tablespoons for the
        sauce. Add the doubanjiang and fry for about 30 seconds. Add the garlic
        and ginger, stir well, and fry for another minute or so.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the stock, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar and stir until the sauce is
        uniform. Simmer for a minute or two to allow the flavour to meld.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggplant, then the corn starch and stir gently. Add the green
        onions and stir one last time.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and splash on a small spoonful of sesame oil.</li>
