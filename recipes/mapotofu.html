    <p>
      Mapo tofu is a specialty of China’s <strong>Sichuan</strong> province, and
      a paragon of the region’s famed ma la, or numbing and spicy, flavor. The
      complex flavor of this Chinese dish comes from three key ingredients:
      Sichuan chili flakes, umami-rich <strong>doubanjiang</strong> (a fermented
      chile–broad bean paste), and citrusy, tingling, mildly mouth-numbing
      Sichuan peppercorns (the berry of a prickly ash tree). Together, these
      ingredients bring a complex burn to the stew-like mapo tofu, which
      combines ground pork, douchi (fermented black beans), soy sauce, chicken
      stock, and cubes of creamy soft tofu for a quick-cooking wok meal.
      Thickened with cornstarch and garnished with green onions and ground
      Sichuan pepper, mapo tofu is best served over steamed white rice, with a
      refreshing, cooling beverage alongside.

      We tested this mapo tofu recipe with several brands of fermented bean and
      chili paste, each varying in flavor and texture. Anything labeled “toban
      jiang” or “doubanjiang” will work, but it’s worth seeking out jars labeled
      <strong>Pixian</strong> or <strong>Chengdu </strong> for this icon of
      Sichuan cuisine.
