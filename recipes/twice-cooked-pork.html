    <p>
      Twice cooked pork is a classic Sichuan dish cooked with a unique Sichuan
      cooking method- double cooking or Hui Guo (回锅). So the other name for
      this dish is doubled-cooked pork or Hui Guo Rou.
    </p>
    <p>
      The origins of twice-cooked pork are believed to date back to the Song
      Dynasty when this pork is mainly cooked as a savory but not spicy one.
      Along with the importing of chili pepper and the creation of doubanjiang,
      twice-cooked pork was formed as a spicy and savory stir-frying dish and it
      obtained great popularity since then.
    </p>
    <p>It will go through two stages of cooking.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Firstly, large chunks of pork belly are braised in clean water for
        around 20 to 30 minutes until soft and well-cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then it is sliced thinly and stir-fried with seasonings and side
        ingredients.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So
      <strong>the name "twice cooked pork" is after the cooking method</strong>,
      quite similar to Sichuan water-boiled dishes or dry frying dishes like
      Sichuan dry frying green beans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooking twice is a very traditional way of cooking pork belly with this
      method. Pork belly needs a longer cooking time, compared with other cuts.
      So, if we cook it directly, the overlong cooking process may turn the pork
      into something dry and quite hard to chew. Cooking it first can shorten
      the stir-frying process to an acceptable time and thus creating a lovely
      sticky, soft texture.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><em>4 servings</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds pork belly (fresh unsmoked bacon), in one piece</li>
